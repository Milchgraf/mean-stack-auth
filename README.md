# schema:

user data is stored in MongoDB, with the passwords hashed
CRUD functions are built in an Express API — Create (register), Read (login, get profile), Update, Delete
an Angular application calls the API and deals with the responses
the Express API generates a JSON Web Token (JWT, pronounced “Jot”) upon registration or login, and passes this to the Angular application
the Angular application stores the JWT in order to maintain the user’s session
the Angular application checks the validity of the JWT when displaying protected views
the Angular application passes the JWT back to Express when calling protected API routes.
